# CriminalIntent
The idea of CriminalIntent app is to create a new crime with a title, and a date when it has happened, take a photo of the crime, 
add a suspect and his phone number.

This app helped me better understand fragments, Singleton class to represent only one fragment at a time, take photos with the camera and
save it to our device, pop up dialogs, contacts API to fetch phone contacts list and create a intent for calling that selected number.
I also learned about Master Detail flow and its use on tablet devices.
