# CriminalIntent
The idea of CriminalIntent app is to create a new crime with a title, and a date when it has happened, take a photo of the crime, 
add a suspect and his phone number.

The development part of this app is to play arround with fragments, Singleton class to rerpesetn only one fragment at a time(more details in app),
playing around with the camera to save a photo taken from our cammera app and saved to our device for futurre reference, 
playing with date picker dialogs, contacts api, making an intent to call a person from our contancts, an SQLite database to store our information,
and playing with Master Detail Flow, to have separate views for each crime and the main crime list view, or  all the crimes on a portion of
a tablet screen and the selected crime on the other part of the screen usign the master detail flow.
App also includes the use of view pager to flip between different crims and learn how to use this layout.
